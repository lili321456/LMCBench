- [[Fully supported]] - Most information in the statement is supported by or extracted from the snippet. This applies only to cases where the statement and parts of the snippet are almost identical. 
- [[Partially supported]] - More than half of the content in the statement is supported by the snippet, but a small portion is either not mentioned or contradicts the snippet. For example, if the statement has two key points and the snippet supports only one of them, it should be considered [Partially supported].
- [[No support]] - The statement is largely unrelated to the snippet, or most key points in the statement do not align with the content of the snippet.
